This module contains a flexible and robust sinusoidal waveform generator written in VHDL.
Also known as a direct digital synthesizer (DDS), numerically controlled oscillator (NCO), or
a sine/sinus wave generator.
It supports an SFDR of 192 dB in fractional phase mode, and theoretically unlimited SFDR in
integer phase mode.
Both sine and cosine outputs are supported, for I/Q modulation and other applications.
