Added

* Add :ref:`common.handshake_pipeline` generic ``pipeline_data_signals`` with default value
  ``true``, and implement mode that pipelines control signals but not data.

* Add :ref:`fifo.fifo` and :ref:`fifo.asynchronous_fifo` generic ``enable_output_register`` with
  default value ``false``, which adds a pipeline stage for RAM output data.

* Add :ref:`bfm.axi_read_master` and :ref:`bfm.axi_write_master` BFMs that create and verify
  AXI transactions.

* Add :ref:`axi.axi_read_pipeline` and :ref:`axi.axi_write_pipeline` blocks that pipeline an
  AXI bus.

Bug fixes

* Fix full throughput in :ref:`common.keep_remover` when not all input lanes are strobed.

* Fix bug in :ref:`axi.axi_write_throttle` where rogue ``AW`` transactions could occur.

* Fix handling of handshake signals in :ref:`common.handshake_splitter` to be AXI-Stream compliant.

Breaking changes

* Rework :ref:`common.handshake_splitter` to use ``std_logic_vector`` for ``output_ready``
  and ``output_valid``. Introduce mandatory generic ``num_interfaces``.

* Change :ref:`common.handshake_pipeline` and :ref:`axi_lite.axi_lite_pipeline` generics
  ``allow_poor_input_ready_timing`` with default value ``false`` to ``pipeline_control_signals``
  with default value ``True``.

* Rename :ref:`bfm.axi_stream_slave` and :ref:`bfm.handshake_slave` generic
  ``remove_strobed_out_dont_care`` to ``remove_strobed_out_invalid_data``.

* Drive output signals with ``'X'`` per default when ``valid`` is low
  in :ref:`bfm.axi_stream_master`.

* Rename generics ``data_width_bits`` to ``data_width``, ``id_width_bits`` to ``id_width``,
  and ``strobe_unit_width_bits`` to ``strobe_unit_width_bits``
  in :ref:`bfm.axi_stream_master` and :ref:`bfm.axi_stream_slave`.

* Remove default value for ``id_width`` generic, which could potentially hide errors, in
  :ref:`bfm.axi_slave`, :ref:`bfm.axi_read_slave` and :ref:`bfm.axi_write_slave`.
  Now the user has to set an explicit value for every instance.

* Rework :ref:`axi.axi_write_throttle` concept completely, as part of a bug fix.
  It is simpler and more light weight now.
  The ``data_fifo_level`` port as well as all generics have been removed.

* Rename generic ``pipeline`` to ``pipeline_axi_lite`` in :ref:`axi_lite.axi_to_axi_lite_vec`.
